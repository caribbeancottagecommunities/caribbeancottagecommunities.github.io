<h1>Searching This Collection With JSS</h1>

Type one or several words in the search form above.
The list of documents or pages that contain all the 
words in the list will be displayed.
<p>
If a pair of words is separated by the keyword "OR",
the list of articles that contains either of the
two words will be displayed.
Example:<br>
<tt>lecun OR bottou</tt>
<p>
If a word is preceded by "-", documents that do not
contain the word will be displayed. Example<br>:
<tt>bottou -lecun</tt><br>
will display the documents that contain "bottou", but not "lecun".
<p>
Query words are "stemmed" (plural and terminations are removed).
To avoid stemming (e.g. for proper names and acronyms) capitalize the words.
