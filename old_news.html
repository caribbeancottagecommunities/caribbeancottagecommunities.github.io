                  <P><strong>GUAVA RIDGE - PHASE II WIND-SOLAR SYSTEM REBATE ($1500)</strong> - <em> 11 July 2011</em><br>
All  homes in Guava Ridge will have their own self contained power systems which will give homeowners substantial savings. Island power is now at over 40 cents (USD) per kWh, about 3.5 times the average US rate and has frequent outages, inconsistent voltage and other problems. Our hybrid wind-solar systems will pay for themselves fully in less than 3 years and deliver consistant, more cost effective, clean energy. <strong>As a <a href="images/energy_system_coupon.jpg">special incentive</a>, we are  offering, with any  lot purchase, to pay the first $1500 of your hybrid wind-solar system installation costs.</strong></P>
                  <p><strong>GUAVA RIDGE - PHASE II PRICING </strong> - <em> 11 July 2011</em><br>
                    <a href="property_5.html">Phase II</a> lot prices are now available. Prices range from $15,000 to $39,000 depending on the size of the lot. Phase II lots are larger home-sites with a large ridge-top width of 90 to 100ft or more. They are on average 100ft or more in elevation above phase II lots with even more extensive views and stronger trade wind breezes. Two lots  are available at special discount rate: Lot 6 at $15,000 and Lot 3 at $25,000.</p>
                  <p><strong>GUAVA RIDGE - PHASE II LOT PLAN</strong> - <em> 6 July 2011</em><br>
                    Phase II lots will be available for sale very shortly. A <a href="images/properties/phase2_lot_plan.jpg">lot plan</a> is available for sneak preview.</p>
                  <P><strong>PHASE II EARLY BIRD DEALS</strong> - <em> 4 January 2011</em><br>
                    Five Phase II estate  lots,  will be available in the new year. These exclusive lots come with over 100' of ridge top face directly to the sea and cooling trade winds all with extraordinary panoramic views, security and privacy. There will be no neighbors in front or behind you. We offer a substantial discount at this time for the first lot of your choice. Please inquire. </P>
                  <P><strong>ONLY THREE LOTS LEFT</strong> - <em> 4 January 2011</em><br>
                    Only three lots remain in the Guava Ridge development with Lot D at $19,500, 
                    Lot G at $29,500 and Lot B with guesthouse now at a reduced price of $39,500. The guesthouse includes a cistern and plans and permits for a mainhouse. This will allow the buyer to live on site while building their home and later rent the guesthouse for income or keep it for visitors. This is the best opportunity on the island. Photos available very soon.</P>
                  <P><strong>BUYING OPPORTUNITY</strong> - <em> 6 October 2010</em><br>
                    We have some great price  opportunities for you.  Lot D is now just $19,500 and the West End lot  is also now at only $22,000. Take advantage of this great price for a nice lot with power, road and water in a new sub-division, only minutes from the popular West End. See the <a href="property_3.html">West End Lot property page</a> for more details. </P>
                  <P><strong>HONDURAS ELECTION</strong> - <em> 30 November 2009</em> <br>
                    The election in Honduras went very smoothly and uneventfully on 29 November and the drama is over. Things on the island were always isolated from this to a large extent. What was remarkable was how the people of Honduras stood up to this threat to their freedom and defended their constitution and with so little conflict. Two other things are remarkable, the first being the depth of the inaccuracy of what the media reported in the U.S., and the second being that this poor country stood virtually alone in defending itself against such a powerful threat with strong support and interference from outside the country. This remains with the people here and will for a very long time. Honduras is moving ahead. Roatan is very much a buying opportunity as things are more 'negotiable' than they have been for years. The country passed a historical test of it's democracy. I am very proud of what has happened here and my adopted home. -Ron Griffith </P>

                  <p><strong>TACA IS BACK!</strong> - <em> 1 June 2009</em> <br>
                    Starting June 12th TACA airlines will be again offering service to both Roatan and San Pedro Sula. After discontinuing service after the price of oil spiked last year, the airline has decided to once again start things up. For those not familiar, TACA is a very large airline that serviced the island for years previous to either Delta and Continental. Many from the U.S. who do not travel to Central and South America may not recognize the name but TACA fly out of Los Angeles, New York, Houston, Miami and run one of the most modern fleets in the world, (normally Airbus). For those looking for a bargain ride to the island, the price offered right now is only $348.00 return from Miami with flights on Thursday and Sunday. From what we have been told this is a four month test to see if the market is viable once again for them. A great time to fly at prices not seen in many years. If you are looking for that vacation to decompress, research, or view our great summer special on the few remaining lots, now is a really great time for your pocketbook. </p>
                  <P><strong>NEW SPECIAL OFFER ON GUAVA RIDGE LOTS (ROATAN) </strong> - <em> 7 May 2009<br>
                  </em>We know things are a little tough up north so we are holding the special pricing for now and offering this to help: an additional 10% off special pricing (see below) for cash sales or we will finance with 40% down and all costs (appox. $2200), 30% in six months, and 30% at end of one year. We are anxious to sell the remaining lots and move on to phase II. Please contact  Ron for details. </P>
                  <P><strong>UPDATE FROM ROATAN ON ECONOMIC OUTLOOK </strong> - <em> 15 Apr 2009<br>
                  </em>Roatan will soon have its first comprehensive full service hospital. This is something we have long awaited and is great news. Other infrastructure continues to be improved and recently all paved roads were repaired from rainy season damage. A new water treatment plant is being built in Flowers Bay. The new Mega Mall with CinePlex theater and the <a href="http://hondurasnews.com/2009/03/18/new-golf-course-in-roatan/">Pete Dye golf course</a> should be completed by year end. The <a href="http://www.cruise-ship-report.com/News/031607.htm">second cruise ship dock (Carnival Line)</a> is nearly complete at Dixon Cove and they have signed a 30 year lease for Coral Cay and are near completion of their resort there as well. Economic events up north have affected the island economy but Roatan is still growing and moving ahead much more quickly. Its a great time to buy on Roatan!</P>
                  <P><strong>NEW PHOTOS FOR GUAVA RIDGE AVAILABLE</strong> - <em> 18 Mar 2009</em> <br>
                    New <a href="images/properties/guava_ridge_views/views.html">photos of  the Guava Ridge (Roatan) lots</a> are now available as well as corresponding ocean views from each. Just click on the red arrows to see each photo/view. </P>
                  <P><strong>SEAT SALES FOR FLIGHTS TO ROATAN</strong> - <em> 17 Mar 2009</em> <br>
                    For people considering a visit to view lots, <a href="http://www.conquestvacations.com/intro/destination.asp?dest=rtb">Conquest Vacations</a> is currently selling  off seats on flights to Roatan. This past Friday's flight from Toronto to Roatan was selling for $309 total. There are also good flight prices and vacation packages from Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver to La Ceiba (just a short ferry-ride away from Roatan). These flights end the second friday in April. Weather here is clear and hot with a strong cool SE trade wind. Gorgeous! </P>
                  <P><strong>EXCELLENT OUTLOOK FOR BAY ISLANDS REAL ESTATE</strong> - <em> 1 Dec 2008</em> <br>
                    With the US election settled, the Caribbean is once again the first market to see the benefits from people wanting to invest in property markets. Roatan and the Bay Islands are particularly well-situated with low capital gains tax (4% on Roatan - and no further tax when you repatriate the money to the USA), a growing economy (from 2010 there will be 3000 cruise ship visitors a day, a new Pete Dye signature golf course, and property prices rising by at least 10% per year) and daily direct flights from Miami, Houston, Atlanta, NY JFK, Toronto and weekly flights from Milan Italy. Consider this ... The Bay Islands market is still a young market that has yet to appreciate nearly to the values in The Caymans, Turks and Cacos, Virgin Islands, Barbados or others (where average properties now cost $1000/sqft).</P>
                  <P><strong>NEW HOME BUILDING IDEAS</strong> - <em> 10 Nov 2008</em> <br>
                    We have added a new link for <a href="http://www.thai-land-house.com/">Thai-land-house.com</a> to the <a href="links.html#home_building">Home Building Ideas</a> section of our <a href="links.html">links page</a>. These designs are simple, a very good fit for our sites, affordable to build and they provide complete plans at a very reasonable price.</P>
                  <P><strong>AIRFARE DEALS</strong> - <em> 3 Nov 2008</em> <br>
                    Due to the cost of fuel falling and slower demand,  flight prices have fallen and there are some real deals out there for those coming to view our properties. <a href="http://www.kayak.com/">www.kayak.com</a> is an excellent discount site for Honduras flights. For Canadians, Conquest tours has direct flights to Roatan that are selling at very good discounts. Phone them directly to ask about availability and some very good discounted prices (1-866-266-7974). </P>
                  <P><strong>ROATAN DEVELOPMENT NEWS</strong> - <em> 3 Nov 2008</em> <br>
                    The new 'Mega-Mall' on Roatan is progressing very quickly and several other smaller malls are moving ahead. This adds more North American goods and services to the mix on Roatan for those who want them. The new Pete Dye 18 hole golf course and Black Pearl Resort are also progressing very well. This is a world class development and along with several other high end Condo and resort developments represents a 'coming of age' for Roatan in the international markets. This will drive values upwards as has happened in all other caribbean markets. We believe it is a very good time to invest, while prices are still affordable and we are discounting our phase I lots. </P>
                  <P><strong>MORE FLIGHT OPTIONS FOR ROATAN</strong><em> - 
                    22 Aug 2008</em><br>
