                  <h3>Can't find what you are looking for?</h3>
                  <p>Please contact Ron at <a href="mailto:griffith_ron@hotmail.com">griffith_ron@hotmail.com</a> or 504-3355-3954. </p>
                 <h3><a name="purchasing"></a>What is involved in purchasing property?</h3>
                  <p>The actual purchase of the land in Honduras is a straightforward, uncomplicated process. We offer direct transfer of title (escritura publica) on closing without the usual 10% plus real estate broker fees and with the help of our trusted lawyer (or you may wish to secure your own). Foreigners, as individuals, can own up to .75 of an acre of land directly. When purchasing land in Honduras, it is important to have a good understanding of the documents associated with clear title. Primarily this involves clear registered title, current survey (this is very modern on Roatan) and no claims against the property or ownership disputes. Our properties have clear title, new surveys and have been cleared of all possible claims. To protect your investment, and give you peace of mind a lawyer should assist with reviewing the documents. Title insurance is available if you feel it necessary. Titles are free-hold and secure in Honduras whether you are a local or foreigner.</p>
                  <h3><a name="financing"></a>Do you offer financing?</h3>
                  <p>Yes. We will offer financing on an individual basis. Please contact Ron Griffith directly to discuss details or see <a href="financing.html">Financing</a> page. </p>
                  <h3><a name="good_time"></a>Is now a good time to buy?</h3>
                  <p>Yes, as interest in this market has grown substantially in the last 3 years due to greater exposure to prospective buyers from expanded tourism, cruise ships, and the completion of the world class 18 hole gold course at Pristine Bay. Also new shopping centers and many new stores have opened and more are planned for the near future. The island has matured in many ways with many new excellent restaurants,   supermarkets, and shopping mall all offering good selections of foodstuffs,   baked goods and wine and spirits. Excellent local island style foods and   restaurants are of course still widely available also giving us the   best of both worlds. The 'expatriot' community has grown substantially   the last few years as well with a large increase in the Canadian group   who have taken to 'island life' very well.</p>
                  <h3><a name="building"></a>What is the cost of building?</h3>
                  <p>Wood construction can range between $50 &gt; $65 sq. ft. and concrete is about $80 sq. ft. but we have an excellent local builder who works for us and can build for you at a very reasonable cost. We will supervise construction for you if you can not . These are averages and will vary with your home design and the options you choose of course. Most building materials are available on the island or, if not, on the mainland. Note that especially beautiful local hardwoods, ceramic tile and stone, local custom crafted doors, hand painted ceramic sinks and many other unique locally crafted items can be incorporated to create a truly beautiful and personal island home design. Some special items may not be available. Those could be ordered from the U.S. and shipped to the island on one of two main freight carriers from Miami or Houston.</p>
                  <h3><a name="utilities"></a>What utilities are available?</h3>
                  <p>There is a local water system but most of the water comes from private wells. A new code requires all new homes to have a minimum 10,000 gallon cistern to collect frequent year round rain water and this is generally sufficient for most homeowners. Roatan has abundant natural water with many streams and springs but it is important to protect this resource. All homes in Guava Ridge are and will be self sustaining for water and   electricity. Water is all collected rain water but we also have a deep   well conection with a line to all lots. All electricity is by wind solar   hybrid power systems. Drinking water is best purchased locally. Roatan Electric Company, RECO, provides the electricity and it is distributed to the majority of the island but power outages and surges are frequent, it is diesel generated, and to very expensive, unstable and unreliable. Please see our Sustainable Building Model on the Home page for detailed information. The main power line is very close to our site but we do not intend to hook up to it as alternative energy (solar and wind) is very effective and cost efficient in The Bay Islands, more dependable, and simply put the best way to go for the future; however if residents wish to hook up to island power....this can be done very easily at reasonable installation costs. We intend to encourage a joint solar/wind power supply which makes this alternative option an even more attractive choice and will manage the construction and installation on a site. Sewage treatment is by septic tank and leach field and <a href="http://www.malibuwater.com/Piranha.html">Pirana</a>  and <a href="http://www.bayies.com/biodigesters.htm">Biodigester systems</a> are also available.  Hondutel is the local phone company of Honduras but cell phones and calling cards are generally cheaper. Note you may have to 'unlock' your cell phone for it to function in Honduras.</p>
                  <h3><a name="languages"></a>What languages are spoken?</h3>
                  <p>Spanish is the official language of Honduras but English is the first language of native Bay Islanders and is spoken by the long term inhabitants who are primarily of african/european/amer-indian or hispanic heritage. Roatan has seen more migration form the mainland in recent years, and most of these people are Spanish speaking making the island bilingual, more or less. Generally you do not need to speak Spanish in the islands...however learning some basic vocabulary can be very useful and will expand your experience significantly. In contrast, few Hondurans on the mainland speak English fluently.</p>
                  <h3><a name="schooling"></a>Is there schooling available?</h3>
                  <p>There are a number of private, bilingual schools, located on the island. There is also a public school system.</p>
                  <h3><a name="medical"></a>What medical care is available?</h3>
                  <p>There is one basic hospital on the island and several clinics from which to choose. A small new, three story medical center has been built in Coxen Hole. There are also several very good hospitals on the mainland in La Ceiba close by and in San Pedro Sula with excellent doctors many of which trained in the U.S. </p>
                  <h3><a name="taxes"></a>What is the situation with taxes?</h3>
                  <p>Property taxes are very affordable. Expect to pay about $ 3.50/ $1000.00. as an example: Property valued at $100,000.00 would be assessed about $350.00 / year property taxes. Absurd property taxes are a North American affliction. Income tax is extremely low (20% maximum) compared to Europe or N. America and sales taxes are typical. Please see the FAQ &quot;What Is The Bay Islands Free Zone&quot; for more information.</p>
                  <h3><a name="building_restrictions"></a>Are there any building restrictions?</h3>
                  <p>Depending on what you wish to do with your property in Honduras, you will probably have to apply for a permit. It is a building permit for a house. With a house, the main concerns are sewage treatment, height restrictions, and structural integrity. Our site provides an excellent stable site to build on with clay base over rock and of course immediate drainage due to our ridge top setting. Some storms do 


occasionally

 pass through Roatan, but unlike most of the Caribbean, these islands are south of the hurricane belt and rarely experience any serious damage from their effects. You should, of course, build to allow for potential storms and high winds and all local builders are familiar with these standards. Trees are protected on Roatan and you may not get permission to cut down a major tree. On our ridge top building sites this is not a problem as most major trees are in the forests in the ravines to the west and east. We have no home owners association, or fees, no restrictions on how you build and encourage you to be creative, follow your own dream and build your own unique designs. We will advise and assist you  anyway we can...and if you like we will take your design and build it for you with our with our experienced   professional builders and craftsmen. If you are a builder we will assist   you in any way we can.  There are 2 cottage lots left (G and D) and 5 Villa lots available (2   through 6). Please see lot details for details and prices.</p>
				  <h3><a name="political_climate"></a>How is the political climate in the Bay Islands?</h3>
                  <p>Honduras has stable government, free elections and has avoided the political violence of some of it's neighbours for decades. It has also had a long and close relationship with the United States that continues today.</p>
                  <h3><a name="retirement" id="retirement"></a>Is Roatan a good place to retire? </h3>
                  <p>Kiplinger.com has voted <a href="http://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/places-to-retire-abroad/7.html">Roatan one of the eight greatest places to retire abroad</a> (<a href="images/kiplinger_roatan.jpg">archived</a>). They cite the great climate, convenient flights from U.S., access to health care, very low cost of living, English-speaking locals, established expat community and real estate bargains. In their words, &quot;Retirees looking for a Caribbean experience for less probably won't be disappointed.&quot; A sentiment we whole-heartedly agree with.</p>
<h3><a name="insurance"></a>Where can I get insurance for my home/property?</h3>
                  <p>Insurance for hurricanes, flooding and many other &quot;acts of god&quot; is available through two companies on the Island.</p>
                  <h3><a name="residency"></a>Do I need to establish residency?</h3>
                  <p>You do not need a Residency number or status to own property in Honduras. You may want to apply for residency for various reasons including allowances for bringing in some items duty free or if you plan to spend more than 90 days at a time on the Island. Obtaining a Residency number can be a lengthy process and should be started from your country of residence before you move to the Island. Information on what is required can be obtained from the Honduran consulate nearest to you. We can also introduce you to lawyers on the Island who can answer questions that are more detailed. There is a new residency law specifically for the Bay Islands that is being put in place.</p>
                  <h3><a name="crime_rate"></a>What is the crime rate like?</h3>
                  <p>Crime on the Island is low and typically &quot;crimes of opportunity&quot;. Much like in many towns and cities in North America. It is not advisable to leave valuables in an unlocked unsupervised vehicle or unsecured home, of course. Violent crime is uncommon in the islands but occasionally occurs, as anywhere else, and usually relates to domestic or local community issues. That said, crime is very low on Roatan Island, streets are safe, and even tourists are not 'harassed' as in many tourist destinations. Local people are fairly religious, conservative, temperate, and very musical. They are warm and friendly and genuine once they know you are &quot;OK&quot;. You may find yourself invited to a pig roast, great singing at a tiny gospel church that WILL make you smile for days, a beach party, or all-night dance at a local dance hall. We encourage building a courtyard type entry as is culturally common, beautiful and suited to our site for both lot privacy and security. You will feel safe walking down the street in the evening and policing on the island is very good. You should however be more careful in the major cites in Honduras especially San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa where gang violence and crime are serious issues.</p>
                  <h3><a name="banking"></a>What banking services are available?</h3>
                  <p>There are several banks to choose from on the Island and all offer checking accounts and savings accounts and most offer visa advances.</p>
                  <h3><a name="airlines"></a>What airlines service the Bay Islands?</h3>
                  <p>Weekly flights are        available direct to the island from Atlanta, Houston, Miami, Milan        and charters from Toronto seasonally. Daily connections are        available to San Pedro Sula with a short connecting flight to the        island.</p>
                  <h3><a name="travel_docs"></a>What travel documents do I need?</h3>
                  <p>A valid passport is needed to enter the country. There is a $33.00 USD departure tax upon exiting the country.</p>
                  <h3><a name="accommodations"></a>What accommodations are available?</h3>
                  <p>There are many fine resorts, B&amp;B's, hostel type 


accommodation, condos and private houses available on the island of every price and variety. These should be booked in advance to ensure availability in peak season. If you are in need of a recommendation or if you need help making arrangements please feel free to contact us for recommendations. We will be glad to assist you. 
                  <h3><a name="work"></a>Can I work in Honduras?</h3>
                  <p>You can work in Honduras with the proper work permits. If you have the management skills and investment capital to start a new business, there are many opportunities from which to choose. An attorney can help you acquire a business license and the other pertinent documents.</p>
